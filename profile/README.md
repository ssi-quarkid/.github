# QuarkID

It is the digital trust framework developed by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires that creates a new digital identity system and gives individuals control over their information, with security anchored through blockchain technology.

## What is it?

Quark ID is a self-sovereign digital identity protocol, open source, that simplifies transactions and allows people to have all their documents in one place, whether issued by public or private institutions, from Argentina and around the world. Quark ID is decentralized, public, permissionless, open, extensible, and capable of interoperating with other similar protocols.

## Guide to issue Verifiable Credentials

To learn more about verifiable credentials, you can find documentation to carry out [this process](https://docs.quarkid.org/en/Quickstart/Creacion%20de%20una%20VC/). As an issuer of a verifiable credential, you must define the information that the credential will contain, i.e., the fields that will be part of the credential's JSON.
